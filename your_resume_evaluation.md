## ❌ Gaps Identified

### Missing Required Skills
- `json` - Not explicitly mentioned (though clearly used)
- `rest` - "RESTful" mentioned but not "REST" keyword
- `saas` - No SaaS-specific language
- `technical support` - **Critical Gap**: No customer support experience highlighted
- `troubleshooting` - **Critical Gap**: No debugging/troubleshooting keywords

### Missing Preferred Skills
- `observability`, `logging`, `dashboard` - No monitoring/observability tools mentioned
- `soap` - Legacy integration protocol (not critical)

### Support Relevance Score: 0.0/0.1
- **This is the biggest gap**: The Ema role emphasizes customer-facing support, troubleshooting production issues, and working with support teams
- Your resume focuses on *building* systems, not *supporting* users

---

## 💡 Actionable Recommendations

### 1. Add Customer-Facing Language
Reframe existing accomplishments to highlight support aspects:

**Before**:
> "Built LLM-powered automated documentation system"

**After**:
> "Built LLM-powered automated documentation system, reducing customer onboarding support tickets by 40%"

### 2. Emphasize Troubleshooting & Debugging
Add bullet points that showcase problem-solving:

**Examples**:
- "Diagnosed and resolved Lambda cold start issues, improving API p99 latency by 35%"
- "Root-cause analysis of distributed system failures using CloudWatch logs and distributed tracing"
- "Debugged production Redis caching issues affecting 500+ concurrent users"

### 3. Highlight SaaS & Production Monitoring
**Examples**:
- "Implemented observability dashboards using Grafana/Prometheus for real-time API health monitoring"
- "On-call rotation for production incidents, maintaining 99.9% uptime SLA"
- "Collaborated with customer success team to troubleshoot API integration failures"

### 4. Explicit Keyword Additions
Add these to your Technical Skills section:
- "RESTful API Design, JSON Schema Validation"
- "Production Troubleshooting, Incident Response"
- "SaaS Platform Engineering"
- "Customer Support Tools (Zendesk, Intercom, etc.)" - if applicable
