TASK:
Evaluate the candidate on three dimensions and return ONLY a JSON object.

**CRITICAL: SKILL MATCHING INSTRUCTIONS**

The candidate has these skills: [Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Flask, Node.js, CloudWatch, DataDog, WordPress, PHP, Stripe]

For skill_match, you MUST:
1. Go through EACH skill in the candidate's list above
2. For EACH skill, determine if it satisfies ANY JD requirement (even if wording differs)
3. Use SEMANTIC matching:
   - "Prometheus" satisfies "logging tools" and "alerting tools"
   - "LangChain" satisfies "GenAI workflows"
   - "REST" satisfies "APIs (JSON, REST, SOAP)"
4. matched_skills = skills FROM THE CANDIDATE'S LIST that match JD requirements
5. missing_skills = skills FROM THE JD that the candidate does NOT have

**CRITICAL: PER-EXPERIENCE RELEVANCE SCORING**

For experience_depth, you MUST:
1. Evaluate EACH experience block INDIVIDUALLY
2. For EACH, assign a relevance_score (0.0-1.0) based on:
   - Does the role involve AI/GenAI, SaaS, technical support, or customer success?
   - Does it involve Python, APIs, troubleshooting, or integrations?
3. Calculate relevant_years = SUM of (duration_years * relevance_score)
4. Base the final score on RELEVANT YEARS, not total years
5. Career switchers with 10y total but 1y relevant should score LOW

**CRITICAL: REQUIRED VS PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS**

If the JD has "Required" and "Preferred" sections:
- Missing REQUIRED skills: heavy penalty (each missing = -0.15 from skill_match)
- Missing PREFERRED skills: light penalty (each missing = -0.05)
- Weight required skills 2x higher than preferred in final calculation

**CRITICAL: FORMULA AND REASONING**

For EACH dimension, include a "formula" key showing exact calculation.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
  "skill_match": {
    "score": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation",
    "formula": "required_matches/total_required * 0.7 + preferred_matches/total_preferred * 0.3 = X",
    "matched_skills": ["skill1", "skill2"],
    "missing_skills": ["skill3"]
  },
  "experience_depth": {
    "score": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation with relevant_years vs total_years",
    "formula": "relevant_years = (role1_years * rel1) + (role2_years * rel2) = X. Score = min(1.0, X/3)",
    "total_years": 0.0,
    "relevant_years": 0.0,
    "experience_breakdown": [
      {"role": "Title", "years": 0.0, "relevance": 0.0, "relevance_reasoning": "Why"}
    ]
  },
  "domain_fit": {
    "score": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation",
    "formula": "domain_matches/total_required_domains = X"
  },
  "overall_assessment": "1-2 sentence summary"
}

SCORING GUIDELINES:

1. **skill_match (0.0-1.0):**
   - 1.0 = ALL required + most preferred
   - 0.8 = ALL required, some preferred
   - 0.6 = MOST required
   - 0.4 = SOME required
   - 0.0 = NO required skills

2. **experience_depth (0.0-1.0):**
   - Based on RELEVANT YEARS ONLY
   - JD requires "3+ years" with 3+ relevant: ≥ 0.7
   - Career switcher (10y total, 1y relevant): ≤ 0.4

3. **domain_fit (0.0-1.0):**
   - AI/ML + customer-facing = high
   - Related domains = medium
   - Unrelated = low
