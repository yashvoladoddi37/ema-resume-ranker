TASK:
Evaluate the candidate on three dimensions and return ONLY a JSON object:

{
  "skill_match": {
    "score": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of skill alignment",
    "matched_skills": ["skill1", "skill2"],

  "domain_fit": {
    "score": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of domain alignment"
  },
  "overall_assessment": "1-2 sentence summary of candidacy"
}

SCORING GUIDELINES:

1. **skill_match (0.0-1.0):**
   - 1.0 = Has ALL required skills + most preferred skills
   - 0.8 = Has ALL required skills, some preferred
   - 0.6 = Has MOST required skills
   - 0.4 = Has SOME required skills
   - 0.2 = Has FEW required skills
   - 0.0 = Has NO required skills

2. **experience_depth (0.0-1.0):**
   - Consider BOTH years AND relevance
   - If JD requires "3+ years" and candidate has 3+: score ≥ 0.7
   - If JD requires "3+ years" and candidate has 2 years: score ≤ 0.6
   - Relevant experience is worth more than total years

3. **domain_fit (0.0-1.0):**
   - How well does candidate's background align with role domain?
   - For AI Applications Engineer: AI/ML background + customer-facing = high
   - Related domains = medium-high
   - Unrelated domains = low

CRITICAL RULES:
- Use the FULL 0.0-1.0 scale
- Be critical but fair
- Return ONLY valid JSON
